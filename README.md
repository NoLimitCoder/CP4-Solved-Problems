CP4 Solved Problems
=============

These are my solutions to the problems presented in the book "Competitive Programming 4". I have created all of the code myself.

I am currently studying Computing Science at Dalhousie University.

Please note that the code used here is not the most beginner-friendly, but the typical competitive programmer's code.

Feel free to look at these solutions for assistance on a problem.
